### HTML Website

**Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?**
I previously took a class on javascript, which made many of these concepts familiar.  I've enjoyed learning how to change the visuals,
and how elements can be layered to create a unique look.  I've found if I plan each assignment well, and design it befor starting, it makes
the project easier to complete.

**Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?**
I'm not anxious about CSS at all.  I've tried to incorporate some into this project with the help of online resources and our text book.
Excited to see what else we get done in the next few weeks!

**Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.**
