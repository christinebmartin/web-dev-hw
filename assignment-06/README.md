### Forms

**Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web**
Being made aware of forms makes you more aware of them.  Forms are everywhere!
I use forms every day through work as people register for webinars and register to receive white papers.
I have completed forms for making hotel and plane reservations.
Today I used a form to order something online.
The one most used form is Google.

**What purposes do the serve?**
Forms facilitate the gathering of data from users through text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, etc. The data is then sent for further processing.

**List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.**
