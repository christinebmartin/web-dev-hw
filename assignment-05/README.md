### Markup

**How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have?**
The main document can have only 1 head and 1 body elements.  

**How are these elements different, or what role do they play?**
The head elements is what is the name shown in the browser.  The page cannot have more than one name.

Tags, elements, text and anything written between the body tags are shown on the browser. Because you only have one browser open at a time you can only have one body element.

**Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.**
Structural elements are just that, they provide structure to the document such as headings, sub-headings, body and paragraphs.  

Semantic markups relay information about the type of content between opening and closing tags such as. Semantic elements are also used for other programs for additional information.  For example, items in blockquotes are recognized by search engines as quotes.

Prior to beginning the assignment I made a list of all required elements to ensure each were completed.

I began building this assignment at a high level first:
- Folders and file structure
- Headers
  -  name
  - Ingredients
  - Directions
  - Contact Me
- Images

Once those were complete and functioning as expected, details for each were added:
- Ingredients
  - unordered list (bullet points)
- Directions
  - ordered list (numbered)

Next the semantic markups were added:
 - abbreviations
 - bold

An html comment was added to save the URL for later use in the external site tag.

After these were tested, additional elements were added:
- Link to external site
- Email Link
- address

Finally, a review of the site for spelling and expected results was completed.
