      <h1>Directions</h1>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Trim off the skin and top layer of fat</strong></li>
            <p>You can ask the butcher to trim the skin for you, but you run the risk of them taking off quite a lot of the top layer of fat. We do like to trim off the fat on top when it is pretty thick, but some people love the fat and like to leave most of it on. A lot of it will render off anyway. You don’t want to trim it all away, but our preference is to trim some, if not most, of the areas of pure fat away. To do this, just use a very sharp knife to make gashes horizontally across the top of the piece of pork belly, peeling away the top layer of skin and fat as you go.</p>

          <li><strong>Cut meat into cubes</strong> Aim for 1 1/2 inch cubes of pork belly. They might seem large, but they will shrink quite a bit as they cook, just like bacon. By the time they are done, your pork belly burnt ends will be perfectly bite-size. If the pork belly is too slippery to slice easily, try sticking it in the freezer for 30 minutes so the fat can firm up a bit, then slice it.</li>

          <li><strong>Rub the meat with dry rub</strong> Drizzle the cubed pork belly with a little olive oil, then sprinkle generously with your favorite pork rub. Try to cover every piece of pork belly evenly with the rub, then arrange them on a wire cooling and baking rack. This makes it easy to get the cubes of meat on and off the grill and it also allows better smoke circulation than putting the pork belly in a pan for the initial smoke. </li>

          <li><strong>Smoke between 225°F and 250°F</strong> for 2 1/2 to 3 hours until dark red and a nice bark starts to form.</li>

          <li><strong>Sauce the meat</strong> Transfer the pork belly cubes to a disposable aluminum pan and add BBQ sauce, butter, and honey, stirring to evenly coat the cubes of pork belly. This will create a braising liquid that will give the sticky sweetness that is characteristic of smoked pork belly burnt ends. Cover the pan with foil, then return the sauced pork belly to the smoker and cook for another 60 to 90 minutes, until the meat reaches 200°F to 205°F when a digital meat thermometer (affiliate link) is inserted into the middle of one of the burnt ends. Really though, the easiest way to really tell if the pork belly burnt ends are done is to test them with a toothpick. If it goes in and comes out easily, the burnt ends are done.</li>

          <li><strong>Remove the foil</strong> and cook for another 15 minutes to let the sauce thicken up a bit, then remove the pork belly burnt ends from the smoker and serve.</li>
        </ol>
