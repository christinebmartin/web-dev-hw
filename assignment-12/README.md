### CSS Website

**Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?**
I actually used a real company, owned by a friend who doesn't have a website.
His requirements:
Must list all services they provide
Must have a way for Property management customers to reach them with an order for items prior to their arrival
Must have a page that explains their expertise and recommendations by prior customers
Must include picture of prior projects, and image of their logo

**What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?**
*Block* starts a new line, always takes up the full width and has top and bottom margins
*Display: inline* have no height and width properties
*Display: inline-block* allows you to set a width and height of an element
