### Final Website

**Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?**
I have previous experience with GitHub, repositories, and version control therefore nothing new was learned in this arena.

**Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?**
I learned a great deal about web design throughout this course.  CSS was the most helpful of everything that was learned this semester.

**Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.**
1. Created a plan on what I wanted the site to look like
2. Because of time constrains and work travel, I had to pair back the repositories
3. Used previously submitted pages/functionality to create the pages.
