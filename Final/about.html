        My name is Christine Martin-Fiore.  My husband, Dave, and I grew up in Maryland, attending rival high schools.  We have 3 adult daughters, and 4 grandchildren (3 girls and 1 boy).  2 of our girls, and all 4 grandchildren, live in the Atlanta suburbs, and our oldest daughter lives in Denver.  We moved to Somers, Montana 4 years ago and enjoy living on Flathead Lake with our dog, Glacier.

        I am a stage 3 colorectal cancer survivor and have been in remission for 8 1/2 yrs.  I frequently participate in <a href="https://www.ccalliance.org/">Colorectal Cancer Alliance </a> events and fundraiser to bring awareness to the disease with the hope of helping 1 person find it early.  I also am active with the Susan G Komen foundation and have participated in 10 Komen 3-Day Walks in Atlanta and San Diego. While I didn't have breast cancer, I was with my best friend as she took her last breath, leaving her husband and 3 young children, when she was 35 years old.  I made her a promise that I would keep raising awareness and raising funds to help find a cure for breast cancer.  The sore muscles and blisters from walking 60-miles don't come close the treatments breast cancer patients endure.  My cancer journey was horrible, but nothing compared to breast cancer paitents.<br> <br>

        I am a Director of Partnerships for <a href="www.phocassoftware.com">Phocas Software</a>, a software-as-service business intelligence company based out of Reno, Nevada.  Prior to joining Phocas, I spent 15 years as a Senior Solutions Consultant at Avalara, a software-as-a-service tax company. I have been considered an expert in state and local tax compliance.  I have published articles and spoken at countless conference on the topic.  I am fortunate enough to have worked at Avalara when they had their initial public offering (IPO) and was there when the executives rang the opening bell on Wall Street.  My hope is to be able to do that again in a few years with Phocas.

        <p>In keeping my promise to my dear friend Abbey, please consider participating in, or donatig to, the <a href="https://https://www.komen.org/">Komen Foundation</a>
