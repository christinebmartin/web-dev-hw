**Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?**
Visiting The Wayback Machine I visited the October 2013 site for Food Netowrk
Compared to the same site today, there are fewer pictures in 2013.
The most recent version has a "hamburger menu" rather than the extensive menu on the old site.
Current site now offers a Watch Live option.

**Summarize your experience with the GIT Module. What did you learn? What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood?**
I used the GIT Module when I took Intro to Media Arts.  It makes updating much easier and reducing the risk of deleting files in error.
When I first began using it I was confused about what the purpose of it was.  I learned rather quickly that it made the Git update process tremendously more efficient.  I find it quite easy to use now.
