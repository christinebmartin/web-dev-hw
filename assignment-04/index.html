    <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
    <h2>Robert Frost</h2>

    <hr />
    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
        And sorry I could not travel both<br />
        And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
        And looked down one as far as I could<br />
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
    <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
        And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
        Though as for that the passing there<br />
        Had worn them really about the same,</p>
    <p>And both that morning equally lay<br />
        In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
        I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
    <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br />
        I took the one less traveled by,<br />
        And that has made all the difference.</p>
