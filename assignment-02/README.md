# Assignment 2
## Christine Martin
I work for a technology company and spend a lot of time with internal teams discussing how our software should function and look. I enjoy the creative side of my work, although I spend most time with partners and bringing in potential customers.  Two years ago I took Introduction to Media Arts and loved it! I enjoyed the class so much I wanted to expand my knowledge.
As I worked with my advisor on a degree path, multidisciplinary studies fit perfectly.  And within the plan media arts was a must have for me not just for my career but personal growth as well.

**What I hope to learn in this course**
1.  Learning html
2.  Trouble shooting
3.  Building a fantastic, functional website
