# Assignment 2
## Christine Martin
I work for a technology company and spend a lot of time with internal teams discussing how our software should function and what it should look like for our users. I enjoy the creative side of my work, although I spend most time with partners and bringing in potential customers. This class will help me speak more intelligently with our developers on what I would like to see, and also help me understand what they're conveying. Two years ago I took Introduction to Media Arts and loved it! I enjoyed the class so much I wanted to expand my knowledge.  As I worked with my advisor on a degree path, multidisciplinary studies fit perfectly.  Within the degree plan media arts was a must have for me not just for my career but personal growth as well.

**What I hope to learn in this course**
1.  Learning html
2.  Trouble shooting
3.  Building a fantastic, functional website
