    <p> This is part of our Susan G Komen 3-Day team.  We have participated in 10 3-Day Walks in Atlanta and San Diego and have raised more than $200,000 to help support breast cancer research and programs.  We have lost several friends to breast cancer, and I am a stage 3 survivor.  While walking more than 60 miles at each event leaves us with blisters, sore muscles and bruised all over, it doesn't compare to what warriors go through during treatment. We love this event, the friendships we have created, the opportunities created because of the funds we've raised and the potential for more mothers to see their chidlren grow up.  Can't wait to get back on the road with these amazing women.</p>
