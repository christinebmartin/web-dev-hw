**Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans**
The <div> element is simply a container to group its contents so a style can be easily added by using classes or id attributes.  

The class attribute specifies a name for an element, any HTML element, however it is mostly used to apply a style.  Class attribute specifies an action to be taken on one or more elements.  In this week's assignment each <div> element is assigned the class "Container".  Within the Head we define what style everything in the class "Container" should use.  We use 2 classes for the Lyrics section, which then applies 2 styles.

The ID attribute is similar to the class attribute, however it is used to indentify a single element.  The ID attribute is only used when a single element should have a specific style applied to it, as opposed to Class which can be applied to multiple elements.

The <span> tag is used for grouping, and applying, styles to inline elements.  Similar to the <div> tag, however <div> is used with a block of content rather than a single line. For example, if I want to apply a specific style to a sentence I can use the <span> tag, however if I want the style to be used to an entire section, I would use the <div> tag.

**What is "alt text," and why do we use it?**
"alt text" provides additional information for an image if a user is unable to view the image.  It is a required element for the <img> element
